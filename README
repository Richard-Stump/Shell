Features specified in the handout that work:
 * 1.1 - 2.8  work
 * 2.9        works for cat <(echo "hello") but not for diff.
 * 3.1-3.5    works
 * 3.7        works

Features specified in the handout that do not work:
 * 2.9  does not work for diff.
 * 3.6  does not work at all

Extra Features that I implemented:
 * When the PROMPT environment variable is not set, the prompt prints
   the current working directory
 * When exiting from terminal, a random exit message is printed from
   a list in shell.cc.
